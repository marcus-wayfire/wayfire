 * is a tree of render instances, called a render tree. The purpose of the
 * render trees is to enable damage tracking (each render instance has its own
 * damage), while allowing arbitrary transformations in the scenegraph (e.g. a
 * render instance does not need to export information about how it transforms
 * its children). Due to this design, render trees have to be regenerated every
 * time the relevant portion of the scenegraph changes.
 *
 * Actually painting a render tree (called render pass) is a process involving
 * three steps:
 *
 * 1. Calculate the damage accumulated from the render tree.
 * 2. A front-to-back iteration through the render tree, so that every node
 *   calculates the parts of the destination buffer it should actually repaint.
 * 3. A final back-to-front iteration where the actual rendering happens.
